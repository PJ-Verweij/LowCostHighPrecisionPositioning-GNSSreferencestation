In this folder you can find software manuals to get the separate hardware components to work on a fresh install of raspberry PI OS

However, there is also aa pre-configured image for the GNSSreferencestation (still to be uploaded)
This image can be written to the SD card using the DD command or the graphical <a href="https://github.com/thefanclub/dd-utility">DD utility</a>. (available for Mac OS and Linux)

In the image you still have to edit file [fixme] to fill the right [mountpoint] and [telecomprovider data]

Also remember to upload the base station configuration to the GNSS receiver using the Ublox U-center software.

# LowCostHighPrecisionPositioning - GNSSreferencestation

This Github repository contains the manual and production files for the GNSSreferencestation. This design is an improved version of BASE2: [ROVER2 and BASE2 githubpage](https://github.com/PJ-Verweij/LowCostHighPrecisionPositioning---BASE2-ROVER2) <br/><br/>

-The CAD_model folder can be downloaded an opened with Solidworks (2019 or higher) <br/>
-The PCB folder can be downloaded and opened with KiCad <br/><br/>

-In the Documentation folder a manual can be found which explains how to assemble the GNSS reference station <br/>
-In the production files folder the STL file of the antenna top can be found to print the antenna top.
Furthermore, there are Gerber files of the PCB. It is handy to notice that some production facilities also accept the Kicad files. <br/><br/>

-In the Software manuals folder some scripts and instructions are given to demonstrate the functionality of the circuits on the PCB.
For the full Raspberry PI software image and configuration I refer to Andreas Krietemeyer.
